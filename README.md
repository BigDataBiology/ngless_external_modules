# NGLess - External modules & community contributions

In this repository you can find [external modules](http://ngless.embl.de/modules.html) for [NGLess](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/ngless).

External modules are thin wrappers around different tools, making them convenient to integrate into NGLess scripts.

## Install

For a quick installation of all modules, clone this repository to some location on your computing servers and use the `install.sh` script provided.
Symbolic links will be created in NGLess' user external module folder pointing to each module and version present in this repository.

## Contributing

If you would like to have your favorite tool available in NGLess, [let us know](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/ngless_external_modules/issues) or open a [pull request](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/ngless_external_modules/pulls)

## Documentation

You can find a `README.md` file inside each external module containing an example script and a table with the arguments that can be passed to the provided NGLess functions.
